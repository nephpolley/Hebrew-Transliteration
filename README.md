# Hebrew Transliterator

A very basic transliterator from English to Hebrew.
## Usage

This transliterator first converts English text into IPA, then approximates the IPA symbols using the Hebrew alphabet.

### Example
```
Input: Hello world
Output: הלו ולד
```

## Note

No diacritics (such as niqqud) are included. The only exception to this so far is אָ.
